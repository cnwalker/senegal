- Water maps need

- Telecom maps recognition of potential by the government

- Not sure what electricity maps

- For each utility I'm going to talk about what it is used for in Senegal, how it is set up, and
then what distance from access to the utility says about people's socio-economic situation. For each
utility I'll map:
    - Life expectancy vs. level of access to utility
    - Household income vs. level of access to utility
    - Level of education vs. level of access to utility
    - Population density vs. level of access to utility
    - Livelihood zones (rural areas) vs distance from a utility
    - Health care facilities vs distance from a utility

- Some deeper ideas about utilities to think about
    - The building of utilities usually exacerbates inequality, but may help the country overall in
    a somewhat "trickle-down" manner
    - Today's luxuries are tomorrow's necessities (re: telecom)
